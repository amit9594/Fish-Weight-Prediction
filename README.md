# Fish-Weight-Prediction

Hey everyone!

If you want to predict weight of a fish you need to give inputs as mentioned in JSON file from postman app. on the basis of input values, it will predict weight of a fish
You need not to write input keys again and again just give values to it.

1) Just create new request file 
2) Give request name and 
3) Add description about it 
4) Create collection 
5) Select that collection folder it 
6) Click on save 
7) Run your .py file on your command prompt 
8) Select post method

10) Select body --> raw --> JSON 
11) Give input
